Feature: Code mutation analysis

  Scenario: Create a simple Java Project
    Given eclipse opens and the welcome screen is acknowledged
    And the java perspective is opened
    And an empty workspace
    #When the PIT views are opened
    And the Console view is closed
    And the user creates a project with name project1
    Then the project project1 exists in the workspace

  Scenario: Create a class Foo and its test
    When a class Foo in package foo.bar is created in project project1
    Then package foo.bar exists in project project1
    And class Foo exists in package foo.bar in project project1
    And a class FooTest in package foo.bar is created in project project1
    And test FooTest in package foo.bar is run for project project1
    Then class FooTest exists in package foo.bar in project project1
    Then a coverage report is generated with 0 classes tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 100%
    Then the mutation results are
      | status | project | class | line | mutation |

  Scenario: Create an empty test
    Given the class FooTest in package foo.bar in project project1 is selected
    When a method "@Test public void fooTest1() {Foo foo = new Foo();}" is created
    And test FooTest in package foo.bar is run for project project1
    Then a coverage report is generated with 0 classes tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 100%
    Then the mutation results are
      | status | project | class | line | mutation |

  Scenario: Create a method in Foo
    Given the class Foo in package foo.bar in project project1 is selected
    When a method "public int doFoo(int i) {return i + 1;}" is created
    And test FooTest in package foo.bar is run for project project1
    Then a coverage report is generated with 1 classes tested with overall coverage of 50% and mutation coverage of 0%
    And the mutation results are
      | status      | project  | package | class       | line | mutation                                                     |
      | LINES_NOT_TESTED | project1 | foo.bar | foo.bar.Foo |    6 | Replaced integer addition with subtraction                   |
      | LINES_NOT_TESTED | project1 | foo.bar | foo.bar.Foo |    6 | replaced int return with 0 for foo/bar/Foo::doFoo            |

  Scenario: Create a bad test for doFoo
    Given the class FooTest in package foo.bar in project project1 is selected
    When a method "@Test public void fooTest2() {new Foo().doFoo(1);}" is created
    And test FooTest in package foo.bar is run for project project1
    Then a coverage report is generated with 1 classes tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 0%
    And the mutation results are
      | status   | project  | package | class       | line | mutation                                                     |
      | SURVIVED | project1 | foo.bar | foo.bar.Foo |    6 | Replaced integer addition with subtraction                   |
      | SURVIVED | project1 | foo.bar | foo.bar.Foo |    6 | replaced int return with 0 for foo/bar/Foo::doFoo           |

  Scenario: Create a better test for doFoo
    Given the class FooTest in package foo.bar in project project1 is selected
    When a method "@Test public void fooTest3() {org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(2, new Foo().doFoo(1));}" is created
    And test FooTest in package foo.bar is run for project project1
    Then a coverage report is generated with 1 classes tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 100%
    And the mutation results are
      | status | project  | package | class       | line | mutation                                                     |
      | KILLED | project1 | foo.bar | foo.bar.Foo |    6 | Replaced integer addition with subtraction                   |
      | KILLED | project1 | foo.bar | foo.bar.Foo |    6 | replaced int return with 0 for foo/bar/Foo::doFoo           |

  Scenario: Run mutation tests at package, package root & project level
    When tests in package foo.bar are run for project project1
    Then a coverage report is generated with 1 class tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 100%
    When tests in source root src are run for project project1
    Then a coverage report is generated with 1 class tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 100%
    When tests are run for project project1
    Then a coverage report is generated with 1 class tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 100%

  Scenario: Create a class Bar and its test
    When a class Bar in package foo.bar is created in project project1
    Then class Bar exists in package foo.bar in project project1
    When a class BarTest in package foo.bar is created in project project1
    Then class BarTest exists in package foo.bar in project project1
    Given the class Bar in package foo.bar in project project1 is selected
    When a method "public int doBar(int i) {return i - 1;}" is created
    Given the class BarTest in package foo.bar in project project1 is selected
    When a method "@Test public void barTestCase1() {org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(0, new Bar().doBar(1));}" is created

  Scenario: Run the new test
    When test BarTest in package foo.bar is run for project project1
    Then a coverage report is generated with 2 classes tested with overall coverage of 50% and mutation coverage of 25%
    And the mutation results are
      | status      | project  | package | class       | line | mutation                                                     |
      | SURVIVED    | project1 | foo.bar | foo.bar.Bar |    6 | replaced int return with 0 for foo/bar/Bar::doBar            |
      | KILLED      | project1 | foo.bar | foo.bar.Bar |    6 | Replaced integer subtraction with addition                   |
      | LINES_NOT_TESTED | project1 | foo.bar | foo.bar.Foo |    6 | Replaced integer addition with subtraction                   |
      | LINES_NOT_TESTED | project1 | foo.bar | foo.bar.Foo |    6 | replaced int return with 0 for foo/bar/Foo::doFoo            |
    When tests in package foo.bar are run for project project1
    Then a coverage report is generated with 2 classes tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 75%
    And the mutation results are
      | status   | project  | package | class       | line | mutation                                                     |
      | SURVIVED | project1 | foo.bar | foo.bar.Bar |    6 | replaced int return with 0 for foo/bar/Bar::doBar            |
      | KILLED   | project1 | foo.bar | foo.bar.Bar |    6 | Replaced integer subtraction with addition                   |
      | KILLED   | project1 | foo.bar | foo.bar.Foo |    6 | Replaced integer addition with subtraction                   |
      | KILLED   | project1 | foo.bar | foo.bar.Foo |    6 | replaced int return with 0 for foo/bar/Foo::doFoo            |
    When tests in source root src are run for project project1
    Then a coverage report is generated with 2 classes tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 75%
    When tests are run for project project1
    Then a coverage report is generated with 2 classes tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 75%
